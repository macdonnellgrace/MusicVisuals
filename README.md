# Description of the assignment

Our assignment is an audio visualiser based on the song Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles

![A different image](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273692d9189b2bd75525893f0c1)

The code works by generating different 2D visuals that interact with certain aspects of the music, such as the frequency and volume. Each is in it's own class and can be called respectively. There is a total of 6 visualisation.

The visualiser is mainly based off the lyrics to the song with natural imagery and other visuals that are inspired by the psychedelic sounds of the music.

# Instructions

To play the visuals you run the main file, making sure that the song is in the data directory.

# How it works

### Visual 1 - Sean
A green bush with strawberries on it and the strawberries grow to a certain size they fall off the bush and the loop. It uses a PNG image of a strawberry and the backdrop PNG image of a bush. This was done because of the strawberry reference

### Visual 2 - Grace
This visual is inspired by the lyrics and fields, showing flowers that change colour based on the prominant frequency. The flowers are also inspired by the 70s fashion and the floral clothing at the time of the song's writing.

### Visual 3 - Grace
Pines trees that grow with the different frequencies of music on a sky backdrop. Each tree grows respective to bands of frequencies, and a line in the song references trees.

### Visual 4 - Sean
A solar system that orbits a sun solar flaring at the rate of the music, with planets orbitting the sun.
Inspired by the "dissonances and eerie space-age sounds" - [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever#Critical_reception)

### Visual 5 - Sean
A binary fractal tree that infinitely expands to the next branch to the next, with the branches swaying to the music. It uses the binary fractal maths along with colour changing branches to do this. The song lyrics also mention trees.

### Visual 6 - Grace
A ocean with fish cycling along the water with bubbles that bubble up and down based on overall frequency level. This was a loose interpretation of the natural imagery in the song.


# What I am most proud of in the assignment

### Grace
I'm most proud of learning how to utilise the map() function and lerp() function to best process the incoming audio. Before the project I was only somewhat familiar with how map() and lerp() worked, but while working with it for all 3 of my visuals I feel like I have a much better understanding of what mapping and lerping do and how useful a function they both are.


### Sean
I'm most proud of my solar system visual in the project, as it was the hardest to code and required a lot of trial and error, particularly when figuring out how to get the ring on the planet. It helped my problem solving skills and team work as I consulted with team members to fix the problem, and it was really rewarding when the visualiser ended up how I envisioned

# What I learned

### Grace
One of the biggest things I learned in this assignment was how to fully use the map and lerp function. The project also gave me a better understanding of how to use GitHub not only myself but collaboratively, as we both needed to communicate with each other when branching and merging.


### Sean
I also learned how to work as a team using GitHub while communicating and merging branches with main, as well as generally getting use to common GitHub commands.
