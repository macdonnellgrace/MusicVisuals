## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

Our assignment is an audio visualiser based on the song Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles

![A different image](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273692d9189b2bd75525893f0c1)

The code works by generating different 2D visuals that interact with certain aspects of the music, such as the frequency and volume. Each is in it's own class and can be called respectively. There is a total of 6 visualisation.

The visualiser is mainly based off the lyrics to the song with natural imagery and other visuals that are inspired by the psychedelic sounds of the music.

# Instructions

To play the visuals you run the main file, making sure that the song is in the data directory.

# How it works

### Visual 1 - Sean
A green bush with strawberries on it and the strabwerries grow to a certain size they fall off the bush and the loop

### Visual 2 - Grace
This visual is inspired by the lyrics and fields, showing flowers that change colour based on the prominant frequency. The flowers are also inspired by the 70s fashion and the floral clothing at the time of the song's writing.

### Visual 3 - Grace
Pines trees that grow with the different frequencies of music on a sky backdrop

### Visual 4 - Sean
A solar system that orbits a sun solar flaring at the rate of the music, with planets orbitting the sun.
Inspired by the "dissonances and eerie space-age sounds" - [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Fields_Forever#Critical_reception)

### Visual 5 - Sean
A binary fractal tree that infinitely expands to the next branch to the next, with the branches swaying to the music.

### Visual 6 - Grace
A ocean with fish cycling along the water with bubbles that bubble up and down based on overall frequency level


# What I am most proud of in the assignment

### Grace
I'm most proud of learning how to utilise the map() function and lerp() function to best process the incoming audio. Before the project I was only somewhat familiar with how map() and lerp() worked, but while working with it for all 3 of my visuals I feel like I have a much better understanding of what mapping and lerping do and how useful a function they both are.

# What I learned

### Grace
One of the biggest things I learned in this assignment was how to fully use the map and lerp function. The project also gave me a better understanding of how to use GitHub not only myself but collaboratively, as we both needed to communicate with each other when branching and merging.
